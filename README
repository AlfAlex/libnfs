LIBNFS is a client library for accessing NFS shares over a network.

LIBNFS offers three different APIs, for different use :
1, RAW : A fully async low level rpc library for nfs protocols
This API is described in include/libnfs-raw.h
it offers a fully async interface to raw XDR encoded blobs.
This api provides very flexible and precice control of the RPC issued.

examples/nfsclient-raw.c provides examples on how to use the raw API

2, NFS ASYNC : A fully asynchronous library for high level vfs functions
This API is described by the *_async() fucntions in include/libnfs.h.
This API provides a fully async access to posix vfs like functions such as 
stat(), read(), ...

examples/nfsclient-async.c provides examples on how to use this API


3, NFS SYNC : A synchronous library for high level vfs functions
This API is described by the *_sync() fucntions in include/libnfs.h.
This API provides access to posix vfs like functions such as 
stat(), read(), ...
